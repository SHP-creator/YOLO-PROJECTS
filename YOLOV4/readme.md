# YOLOV4 OBJECT DETECTION using OPENCV 
This repository contains code for performing real-time object detection using YOLOv4 with Darknet Framework. The YOLOv4 algorithm is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its high accuracy and speed.
## DESCRIPTION
The code in this repository demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLOv4 with Darknet Framework. It takes input from a video file and performs object detection on each frame, drawing bounding boxes and labels around the detected objects. 
    The YOLOv4 model used in this code is based on the yolov4-tiny and yolov4 configuration, which is a lightweight version of YOLOv4 and highweight version of YOLOV4 optimized for faster inference.
## Prerequisites
To run the code, you need the following:

-Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

-OpenCV version 4.5.1 or higher. You can install it using pip install opencv-python.

-Pre-trained YOLOv4 weights (yolov4-tiny.weights) and configuration (yolov4-tiny.cfg) files. These files can be obtained from the official darknet repository.

-Pre-trained YOLOv4 weights (yolov4.weights) and configuration (yolov4.cfg) files. These files can be obtained from the official darknet repository.

-A file named classes.txt containing a list of class names that the YOLOv4 model can detect.
